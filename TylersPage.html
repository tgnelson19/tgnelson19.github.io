			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="images/Tyler'sImages/SDPics/MePicture.jpg" alt="MeImage">
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Tyler Nelson, and I am currently in my junior year at the 
				University of Iowa studying Electrical Engineering with a Radio-frequency Engineering focus. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Over the summer I am going tobe doing a Co-Op at Skyworks Solutions in Cedar Rapids Iowa.
			</p>
			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<img src="images/Tyler'sImages/SDPics/Poster.jpg" alt="MeImage">
			<p>
				During my time in college, I've been busy experiencing as many things as I can.
				Freshmen year was hard for me to find things to do as the lockdown prevented many in person activities from occuring.
				I did join the Hyperloop Club that year though, and am now the systems team co-lead. 
				<br><br>In my Sophomore year I was a
				teaching assistant for Intro to Engineering Computing the first semester, and for Circuits in the second semester. 
				<br><br>During my junior year now I am a research assisstant for Dr.Folland's Quantum Nanophotonics lab. I also am a research assisstant for 
				Dr.Toor's lab where I am developing a compact nitrous oxide sensor. Above is my poster that I presented at the 
				2023 Spring College of Engineering Research Open House.

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>
				If there's something I can do, I probably want to do it. 
				<br><br>I've had many hobbies in my life,
				such as coding, hunting, fishing, football, baseball, video games, rubik's cubes, reading, 
				photography, the list goes on and on.
			</p>
			<h2>Fishing</h2>
			<img src="images/Tyler'sImages/SDPics/BigFish.jpg" alt="MeImage">
			<p>
				When it comes to fishing, you never get to decide how big the fish you catch is. That's 
				why we invented cameras, so that we can make them look bigger. Fishing is fun because it is 
				almost like a game, you always try to find a new way to catch the biggest fish, especially
				before anyone else on the boat does. The only bad part
				is the times when you don't catch any fish, and the worst part is when the fish you catch aren't
				very big at all.
				<br><br>The main place that my family and I go is the 
				Mississippi river, where there are plenty of spots to catch plenty of fish.

			<h2>Photography</h2>

			<p>
				I also enjoy taking lots of pictures, as it's one of the best ways of preserving the moments in 
				our lives that we think are really cool. Above is a pond not too far from where I live that I take my dog on walks around while we watch the sun set. 
			</p>
			<h2>Travelling</h2>
			<img src="images/Tyler'sImages/SDPics/Mountain.jpg" alt="MeImage">
				There's nothing like seeing something that is absolutely massive. Going to the ocean, or seeing big canyons and valleys, and especially mountains. 
				Travelling brings us close to things that look like they belong in story books, and I always find it so interesting to visit 
				these beautiful landmarks.
