			<h2>Lab 1 - Temperature Sensor</h2>
			<img src="images/ProjectImages/tempSense.png" alt="Image 2">
			<p>For the first lab of senior design, we developed a temperature sensor device. 
        It has onboard temperature sensing capabilities, as well as the ability to send 
        the information to a web server that can be accessed remotely to view 
        temperature history and control the device. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/ProjectImages/dataTemp.png" alt="Image 2">
      <p>The user is then able to also set a cell phone number, temperature limits, 
        and specific messages inside of the user interface to be sent to the phone 
        upon those limits being reached. Overall the project helped us improve both 
        our hardware and software capabilities.

			<h2>Lab 2 - Infrared Receiver</h2>
			<img src="images/ProjectImages/Circuit.png" alt="Image 2">
			<p>The second lab of our senior design course involved us developing an 
        infrared receiver to be used in tandem with a transmitter such that when 
        the receiver no longer detects the transmitter, a text message is sent to
         a cell phone stating that a critical safety error has occurred. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/ProjectImages/cirWork.png" alt="Image 2">
      <p>This lab primarily involved us developing the buffering, filtering, 
        and amplifying of the detected signal. We did this in order to filter 
        out any potential noise, specifically the 120 Hz lamp noise generated
         by modern electronics.

			<h2>Lab 3 - Website</h2>
			<p>Our last lab for our senior design course is this website,
         which we had to develop and host for the public to see. Our main skills
          honed here are being able to go through tutorials and learn how to do 
          new things, as all of our team members are exclusively electrical engineers.

			<h2>Final Project - Smarter Fridge Upgrade Module</h2>
			<img src="images/ProjectImages/badFood.png" alt="Image 2">
			<p>Over the course of senior design we had to come up with an idea for 
        what we would like to do for our capstone project. We decided that food 
        waste is much to prevalent in our society, and that there should be an 
        affordable way to easily keep track of all your food items. 
      </p>
      <img src="images/ProjectImages/fridge.png" alt="Image 2">
      <p>Currently it is much too expensive for people to update their perfectly 
        working appliances to fancy new smart fridges, so we are designing an
         upgrade module that can turn any old fridge into a smarter fridge!
          It will allow users to keep track of the inventory of their fridge, 
          as well as the expiration dates of the items. The user then would 
          be able to access this information from either a front panel or 
          remotely from an internet connected device to always be able to 
          know what exactly is in their fridge, and help stop food waste 
          in itâ€™s tracks!
